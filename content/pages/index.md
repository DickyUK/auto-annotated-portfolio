      Our mission is to address the growing problem of electronic waste and
      product obsolescence by engaging young people in the repair and
      repurposing of vintage technology. Through free talks, multi-disciplinary
      projects, and open-source methods, we foster skills in innovation,
      sustainability, and vocational training. Our approach links learning
      across subjects, from coding and materials science to ethics and
      geography, while promoting repairability and circular design. By
      transforming outdated devices into functional, modern technology, we not
      only reduce waste but also fund educational programs and provide students,
      especially those at risk of exclusion, with practical, accredited skills
      for the future.
